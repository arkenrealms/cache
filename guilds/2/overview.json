  "description": "The Archivists are an order based in Westmarch. These brave souls wade into battle wielding tome and quill, armored not in ensorcelled plate or links of chain, but in the knowledge of generations past. These archivists fight not only for the future of humanity, but for mankind's past as well. The members of their honored fraternity are many, and their numbers grow every day.",
